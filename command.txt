Normal Mode (g commands)
gg - Go to the first line of the file.
G - Go to the last line of the file.
gd - Go to the local declaration of the identifier under the cursor.
gD - Go to the global declaration of the identifier under the cursor.
gi - Go to the last place where Insert mode was stopped.
gf - Open the file under the cursor.
gx - Open a file or URL under the cursor.
g% - Go to matching bracket or parentheses.
gU - Uppercase text from the cursor to a motion (e.g., gUw to uppercase the next word).
gu - Lowercase text from the cursor to a motion.
g? - Rot13 encode the text from the cursor to a motion.
ga - Display the ASCII value of the character under the cursor.
gq - Format text based on text width (gqap formats a paragraph).
gw - Format text but preserve current cursor position.
gJ - Join lines without adding a space between them.
g~ - Invert case from the cursor to a motion (e.g., g~w toggles case of the next word).
g* - Search for the word under the cursor, but without whole-word matching.
g# - Search backward for the word under the cursor without whole-word matching.

Visual Mode (g commands)
gU - Uppercase the selected text.
gu - Lowercase the selected text.
g? - Rot13 encode the selected text.
gq - Format the selected text.
g~ - Toggle case of the selected text.
gJ - Join selected lines without adding a space between them.

Insert Mode (g commands)
While Insert mode doesn't have direct g commands, you can use key sequences to switch modes and execute them. Example: <Esc>gi to return to where you last left Insert mode.
Other useful g combinations
g<C-g> - Display current cursor position, line count, and file percentage.
gq{motion} - Format lines (like with = but respecting textwidth).
gn - Select the next match of the current search.
gN - Select the previous match of the current search.

Visual Block Mode (g commands)
gU - Uppercase the selected block of text.
gu - Lowercase the selected block of text.
g? - Apply ROT13 encoding to the selected block of text.
g~ - Invert the case of the selected block of text (e.g., uppercase becomes lowercase, and vice versa).
gq - Format the selected block of text.
g@ - Execute a macro on the selected block of text.
gJ - Join the selected block of lines without adding a space between them.
While the g commands are limited in Visual Block mode compared to Normal and Visual modes, you can still perform powerful text manipulations by selecting blocks and then applying these commands. For instance:

Select a rectangular block of text, then run gU to make all the text in that block uppercase.
Select a block, then use gq to format it according to your textwidth settings.
Let me know if you need more details about working with Visual Block mode!

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how this works in Visual Block mode:
g<C-a> in Visual Block Mode:
g<C-a> - Increment all numbers within the selected block by 1. If you have a column of numbers selected, each number will be increased.
Additional related commands:
g<C-x> - Decrement all the numbers in the selected block by 1.
g<C-a>10 - Increment all the numbers in the selected block by 10. You can specify any number instead of 10 to increment by that amount.
g<C-x>5 - Decrement all the numbers in the selected block by 5 (or any other number you specify).
These commands allow you to quickly adjust numbers in bulk when working with tables, sequences, or repetitive numeric data.

Let me know if you need more examples or specific use cases for this!
Commands Similar to g<C-a> in Visual Block Mode

1. g<C-x> - Decrement Numbers
Decrements all numbers in the selected block by 1. As mentioned earlier, you can use this to decrease numbers in bulk.

2. I and A for Block Insertions
I - Insert text at the beginning of each selected line in the block.
A - Append text to the end of each selected line in the block.
Example: Select a vertical block of text, press I, type some text, and press <Esc>. The text will be added at the beginning of each line in the block.

3. r - Replace Characters in a Block
After selecting a block, press r followed by the character you want to replace the selected text with.
Example: Select a block of characters, press r, and then X to replace every character in the block with X.

4. ~ - Toggle Case
Toggles the case of the selected characters. This works similarly to g~, but for block-selected text.
Example: Select a block of text, press ~, and all letters in that block will toggle between uppercase and lowercase.

5. = - Indent (Auto-format) Block
Automatically formats the selected block of code according to your indentation settings. It can be very useful for fixing indentations in a rectangular block of code.
Example: Select a block of code, press = to re-indent it.

6. > and < - Indent/Un-indent Block
> - Indents the selected block of text to the right.
< - Un-indents (or shifts) the selected block of text to the left.
You can use these commands to adjust indentation in a selected block of text. Just press < or > after selecting a block to shift it.

7. d, c, y in Visual Block Mode
d - Deletes the selected block of text.
c - Changes the selected block of text. It removes the block and puts you in insert mode to replace the text.
y - Yanks (copies) the selected block of text. You can then paste it using p in Normal mode.

8. U for Undoing
In Visual Block mode, after making changes (like increments or case toggles), you can use U to undo changes within the block.

9. J - Join Lines
J - Joins the selected block of lines together. This merges the lines into a single line.

10. x and X for Cutting
x - Deletes the selected characters in the block.
X - Deletes the selected block of characters, but also copies them (similar to d).

11. gv - Reselect Last Visual Block
After leaving Visual Block mode, you can press gv to reselect the same block, allowing you to apply further modifications to it.
Bonus: Ex Commands for Advanced Block Edits
You can combine Visual Block mode with Ex commands (:) for even more advanced editing. For example:

:s/^/prefix/ - After selecting a block, you can use this command to insert a prefix before the beginning of each line in the block.
:norm Itext - After selecting a block, runs the Itext command (inserts text at the beginning) on each line in the block.
These commands give you powerful capabilities for bulk editing, especially in structured text like tables, configuration files, and source code.
